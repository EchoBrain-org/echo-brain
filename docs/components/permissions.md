# Permissions

## Responsibility

Permissions determine whether a specific actor may perform an action or
receive particular organization information. The domain crosses local frozen
approval state, provider action evidence, central membership, record
admission, derived facts, retrieval scope, final authorization checks, and
audit.

Identity answers who the actor is. Permission answers what that actor may do
with a particular action or content boundary.

## Documentation rule

Permission claims must name their enforcement scope. A bounded pilot or one
retrieval operation is not evidence of a globally enforced permission system.
Every served path must link its invariant, enforcement point, denial behavior,
audit evidence, and qualification case.
